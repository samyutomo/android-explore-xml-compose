# About Project
Project to build new layout of Android UI that was previously created using XML to Jetpack Compose.

## Information  
In this project we'll take a deeper dive into one of the hottest Android technologies, Jetpack Compose. 
Jetpack Compose is a modern Android UI toolkit recently released by Google where we can create UI of our Android app entirely using Kotlin language. This project is a compose study by **Kylix Eza Saputra** (Google Certified) to learn the steps to migrate XML to Jetpack Compose. Check it out!
